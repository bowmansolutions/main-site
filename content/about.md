## History

Bowman Solutions was formed in early 2007 when Jonathan freelanced as a computer technician for businesses and homes in the Harrisonburg, VA area. Since then, he has been a student, web developer, and is currently a pastor. We now reside in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

Jonathan continues to learn, imagine, and invent. In his "free time," he might be wrangling with a breadboard, a Linux distribution, a soldering iron, or a web application. Feel free to contact him for consultation, idea-sharing, and troubleshooting.
